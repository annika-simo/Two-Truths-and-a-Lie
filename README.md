# Two-Truths-and-a-Lie
CS1021 Lab 1

## Introduction:
*Two Truths and a Lie* is a fun [ice breaker](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Icebreaker_(facilitation)). Groups of people play this game to get to know one another and we are going to do the same. It is a surprisingly easy and fun game to play. Each contestant tells the group three autobiographical “facts”, but only two are true. The third “fact” is really a lie. After the contestant has divulged their three “facts”, the other participants take turns guessing which one of the contestant’s statements are fabricated.

In our version of the game, instead of making the three statements aloud in front of the group, each contestant will make their statements using a C++ program.

Coming up with the “fact” and facts should be fun! But, if you are having trouble coming up with a good “fact”, there are some suggestions online [here]( https://parade.com/1185071/marynliles/two-truths-and-a-lie-ideas/).

Every lab in this course will have three tasks – a program design task, a programming task, and a critical thinking task. In the program design task, you will be asked to write pseudocode or draw a flowchart for the lab solution you plan to implement. In the programming task, you will be asked to write the C++ code for your solution. In the critical thinking task, you will be asked to synthesize material you learned in class.

Please be sure to read the entire lab document before beginning!

Good luck and have fun!

## Program Design Task:
As my dad always says, "It's better to ask for the mashed potatoes than eat the applesauce." As we learned in class, computer scientists outline their solutions by writing pseudocode or drawing a flowchart. Before you start writing code, please write the pseudocode or draw the flowchart for your implementation of the *Two Truths and a Lie* program.

## Program Design Requirements:
Your pseudocode or flowchart must describe the entirety of the solution. You may choose to write the pseudocode or draw the flowchart at any level of detail but, remember, this is a tool for you! As we progress through the semester, the programs we write will get more complicated and knowing how to read and write pseudocode or draw and interpret a flowchart will be a tremendous benefit!

## Programming Task:
Your programming task is to write an application that prints on the console three autobiographical statements – two statements should be facts and the third should be a lie. The statements should not contain any indication whether they are true or false. Further, the statements do not need to be in any particular order – your program could print to the console two facts then a lie; a fact, a lie, then a fact; or a lie then two facts. Each biographical statement must appear on the screen on a separate line.

## Programming Requirements:
If you are a Windows user, begin with the skeleton code in this repository. Your program must meet the following requirements:

1. Your program takes no input.
2. Your program must output to the console three statements separated by newlines. For example,

```
I played the cello when I was in high school.
My mother is a world-class ballerina.
My sister has surfed in the South Pacific. 
```

3. All statements must be grammatically correct.
4. To print output to the console, your program must use the objects/methods we learned in class.
5. Your program must use two different methods for outputting a newline character to the console.
6. Your program must contain a multi-line comment before the main function describing the purpose of the program. The text in the comment must be grammatically correct and accurately describe the program’s purpose, but not its operation.
7. You must use single-line comments in your program to designate which of the statements is a “fact” and which of the statements are facts.

## Critical Thinking Task:
Compilation is the process of converting a program written in a high-level language into a set of instructions that the CPU can execute. Your task is to draw a flowchart of the compilation process.

## Critical Thinking Requirement:
Your flow chart can be written or diagrammatic. If you choose to draw a flow chart, you may draw it by hand. Make sure that all the steps are labeled appropriately. For each step of the compilation process, write one sentence that describes the step.

## Deliverables:
1. The pseudocode or flowchart describing the algorithm of your Two Truths and a Lie program in PDF format (name the file `design.pdf`);
2. The C++ source code for a program that plays Two Truths and a Lie according to the specifications above (name the file `TwoTruthsAndALie.cpp`);
3. A written or diagrammatic description of the compilation process in PDF format (name the file `compilation.pdf`);
Submit all three files to Gradescope at the same time.

## Related Learning Objectives:
1. Students will be able to compile and execute a C++ program.
2. Students will be able to use C++ to display output to the console.
3. Students will be able to use comments to document code.
4. Students will be able to write the steps of the compilation process.
5. Students will be able to apply algorithmic thinking to writing pseudocode at varying levels of specificity.
